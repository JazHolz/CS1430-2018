  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Lets begin, who am I? <h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
      If you couldn't tell, my name is Jazmine! <br>
    I am currently a Freshmen at Salt Lake Community College in Utah,
  <a target="_blank" href= "http://www.slcc.edu/"> Check it out! </a> <br>
In this fast paced summer semester I am taking on 21 credit hours, freaking nuts right? <br>
I am pursuing a Computer Science degree, I am not sure what path in Computer Science Im looking at yet. <br>
I hope by taking these courses I will be able to see what I enjoy doing in this field.

      I am a happy go lucky girl living life in the fast lane. I am completely obsessed with cats. <br>
That's right! I have two fur baby's myself, a male and female. They are brother and sister and have <br>
been my whole life since they were born on June 3rd, 2014 at 2:40 am. They are half Persian, like myself, <br>
which I find pretty cool. How many people can say that their pets, I bet not many.
