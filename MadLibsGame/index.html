  Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of numbers
  to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud.
  The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.
  The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of Mad Libs
  books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958.
