  <p>
This song shows a definite loss of someone important in the past.

<table>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWakZcEGB38"> Adele - Dont You Remember <a></td>
      <td> Published on Feb 22, 2011.</td>

  </table>
  <p>
This shows a wanting for someone to come back to you, missing, or longing.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryt7rbZJ5wQ"> Adele - Send My Love <a></td>

This is finally shows us a complete moving on type vibe, insisting we are not kids anymore.

<p>
So Adele, with these video's taken into account we can idenify, there was in fact a person of interest. Although it does appear this person of your past is now, no longer of interest.
